day1_server_full.py — Day 1: your first MCP server, built step by step.

The file is organized in the exact order you build it in class.
Read Day1_StepByStep.md alongside — every step is explained there.

BEFORE RUNNING (see Day1_StepByStep.md §0):
    pip install "mcp[cli]" requests
    python -c "import mcp; print('mcp OK')"

RUN:
    python day1_server_full.py
        → from a terminal: HTTP mode at http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/
        → launched by Goose / Claude Desktop: STDIO mode, automatically

WHAT IT EXPOSES (the three MCP primitives — three, not four):
    Tools     (LLM calls these):      read_file, get_weather
    Resource  (host reads this):      notes://today
    Prompt    (user triggers it):     summarize

# ── STEP 1 · The skeleton ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# One import, one line. "Workshop" is the server name every client displays.

# ── STEP 3 · First tool: read the machine ────────────────────────────────────
# The pattern of EVERY tool: decorator · docstring · body · return a string.
# The docstring is NOT documentation — it is the prompt the LLM reads when
# deciding whether to call this tool. Write it like prompt engineering.

# ── STEP 4 · Second tool: reach the live world ───────────────────────────────
# wttr.in: free weather, no API key, no signup. format=3 → one line of text.

# ── STEP 5 · A Resource: data with an address ────────────────────────────────
# The LLM does NOT call this. The HOST reads it (usually at startup) and puts
# it into the model's context. Tools are verbs; resources are nouns.

# ── STEP 6 · A Prompt: a workflow the USER triggers by name ──────────────────
# In a client like Goose the user picks "summarize" from a menu; the returned
# text is sent to the LLM as if the user typed it. Note: it references the
# read_file tool by name — the primitives compose.

# ── STEP 2 · The run block: one file, two transports, zero config ────────────
# isatty() is True when YOU run it from a terminal  → Streamable HTTP (port 8000)
# isatty() is False when a host spawns it as a pipe → STDIO
# (SSE is deprecated; Streamable HTTP is the modern remote transport.)
