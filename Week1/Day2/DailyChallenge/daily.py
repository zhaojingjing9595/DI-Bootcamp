# Challenge 1: Multiples of a Number

# Key Python Topics:
# input() function
# Loops (for or while)
# Lists and appending items
# Basic arithmetic (multiplication)

# Instructions:
# 1. Ask the user for two inputs:

# A number (integer).
# A length (integer).
# 2. Create a program that generates a list of multiples of the given number.
# 3. The list should stop when it reaches the length specified by the user.

# Example 1:

# Input:
# number: 7
# length: 5
# Output:
# [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

# Example 2:

# Input:
# number: 12
# length: 10
# Output:
# [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

# Example 3:

# Input:
# number: 17
# length: 6
# Output:
# [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

while True: 
    input_num = input("Enter a number: ")
    try:
        input_num = int(input_num)
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("This is not an integer!")

while True: 
    input_length = input("Enter a length: ")
    try:
        input_length = int(input_length)
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("This is not an integer!")

out_list = [input_num * i for i in range(1, input_length+1)]
print(out_list)


# Challenge 2: Remove Consecutive Duplicate Letters

# Key Python Topics:
# input() function
# Strings and string manipulation
# Loops (for or while)
# Conditional statements (if)


# Instructions:
# 1. Ask the user for a string.
# 2. Write a program that processes the string to remove consecutive duplicate letters.

# The new string should only contain unique consecutive letters.
# For example, “ppoeemm” should become “poem” (removes consecutive duplicates like ‘pp’, ‘ee’, and ‘mm’).
# 3. The program should print the modified string.



# Example 1:

# Input:
# user’s word: "ppoeemm"
# Output:
# "poem"

# Example 2:

# Input:
# user’s word: "wiiiinnnnd"
# Output:
# "wind"

# Example 3:

# Input:
# user’s word: "ttiiitllleeee"
# Output:
# "title"


# Example 4:

# Input:
# user’s word: "cccccaaarrrbbonnnnn"
# Output:
# "carbon"


# Notes:
# The final string will not include any consecutive duplicates, but non-consecutive duplicates are allowed.
# Example: In "recursive", the two ‘r’s and two ‘e’s are allowed because they are not consecutive.
